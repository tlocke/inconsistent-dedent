My [travails with Prang](http://inconsistent-dedent.tlocke.org.uk/2015/09/a-breakthrough-with-prang.html) continue. It looks like we can now simplify the RELAX NG schema. The work remaining is:  

-   Correctly recognizing invalid RELAX NG schemas
-   Implementing the 'prang' command
-   Finish off docs

Feeling tired. If I said exhausted I would be exaggerating. Maybe I'll finishing this today?
