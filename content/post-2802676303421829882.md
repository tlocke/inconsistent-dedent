[MtrHub](http://www.mtrhub.com/) is hosted on Google AppEngine. A few bugs have accumulated so I need to revisit MtrHub and fix them. First thing though, I need to move from the original datastore API to the memcache-backed NDB API. Also, I really need to make sure that data associated with a particular reader is in the same entity group, to get the strong consistency benefits.  
  
In going from db to ndb, StringListProperty becomes StringProperty with a reapeated=True.
