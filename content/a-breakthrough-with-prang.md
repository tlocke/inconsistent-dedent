On Friday I was [in despair](http://inconsistent-dedent.tlocke.org.uk/2015/09/the-tear-stained-prang.html), but then I made a breakthrough. I tracked down where I had made a mistake in the translation, and that means that Prang passed a few more tests. More than that, the technique for finding the problem worked with the next problem, so I've got a general approach. I still don't understand the algorithm, but I'm understanding the translation. I may be getting over confident, but I think I can crack the whole thing!
