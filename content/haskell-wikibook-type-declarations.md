Here are my answers to the [Haskell Wikibook: Type declarations](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Type_declarations) chapter questions:  

> Reread the function definitions above. Then look closer at the `showDate` helper function. We said it was provided "for the sake of code clarity", but there is a certain clumsiness in the way it is used. You have to pass three separate Int arguments to it, but these arguments are always linked to each other as part of a single date. It would make no sense to do things like passing the year, month and day values of the Anniversary in a different order, or to pass the month value twice and omit the day.

> -   Declare a `Date` type which is composed of three Int, corresponding to year, month and day. Then, rewrite `showDate` so that it uses the new Date data type. What changes will then be needed in `showAnniversary` and the `Anniversary` for them to make use of Date?.
