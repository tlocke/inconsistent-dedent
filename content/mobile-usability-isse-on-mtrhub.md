Well, here I am at the [Meanbee Hack Night](http://www.meetup.com/Meanbee-Hack-Nights/events/222152897/), and I'm planning on working on MtrHub. [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en) flagged up a 'mobile usability issue', so that's what I've got to fix. First thing is to get everything working on my laptop...  
  
Btw, since upgrading to Ubuntu 15.04, git log lines wrap on the terminal screen, which is really useful, as before I had to widen the screen to beyond the sacred 80 characters.  
  
Ah, I've run into a bug in Imprimatur that I've been meaning to fix for ages. I'll do that now. Okay, fixed that bug and made a [new release of Imprimatur](http://pythonhosted.org/imprimatur/).  
  
Home time. Thanks for the pizza and beer Meanbee!
