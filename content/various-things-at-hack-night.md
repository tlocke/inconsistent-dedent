I'm at [Bristol Hack Night at Momentum](http://www.meetup.com/CodeHub-Bristol/events/222548744/) and I'm going to carry on with Odio. Okay, so I've got a test where the desired ODS files is zipped up to create a single file with the .ods extension. Then the actual file is compared against it, and if they match then the test passes. There's a separate program for generating the ODF file, but my task is to integrate this into the tox tests.  
  
Okay, [that's done](https://github.com/tlocke/odio/commit/f6073c2d99f38c848b92b181cba45e14ec36fc90).  
  
Some docs are really needed, let's do that next.
