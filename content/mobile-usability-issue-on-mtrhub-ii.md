This is just a follow-up to a previous post: [Mobile Usability Issue On MtrHub](http://inconsistent-dedent.tlocke.org.uk/2015/05/mobile-usability-isse-on-mtrhub.html). It seems that Google Webmaster tools doesn't like the fact that on a mobile browser the table on the front page was too wide. Webmaster tools was quite right, so I've [reduced it by a couple of columns](http://www.mtrhub.com/) and that fixed it.
