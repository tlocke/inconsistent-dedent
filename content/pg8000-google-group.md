I went to set up a Google Group for [pg8000](https://github.com/mfenniak/pg8000), and I found that there [already is one](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pg8000)! I think it was set up to support the fork hosted on Google Code, but since that doesn't seem to be active any more, perhaps the forum can be used for the original pg8000 project? I think I'll post to the forum and find out.
