I think I'm getting a bit burnt out, and I'm supposed to be on holiday. The [Prang business](http://inconsistent-dedent.tlocke.org.uk/2015/09/prang-travails.html) has become a burden. Should I give up or continue? Continue!  
  
For some reason I thought I wouldn't have to look at [section 7](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/spec-20011203.html#restriction) of the RELAX NG specification. Of course I have to look at it! I think Prang is passing all the 7.1 tests, but that leaves the rest of the section to tackle. Is it all worth it?
