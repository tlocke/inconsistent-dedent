    <p>I wrote a tutorial on propositional logic a couple of weeks ago. I wrote it out on paper, and now comes the task of putting it online. I wanted to write one document and from that produce a website and an EPUB book. My first thought was LaTeX, and I wrote out a few sections using it, and while it was usable I found there was a bit of a mismatch between it and HTML. Overkill in some places and lacking in others.  </p>
<p>Looking around I found Pandoc, which has a dialect of Markdown which can embed LaTeX for maths. This actually looked like a pretty good solution until I found Asciidoc. The thing I was slightly worried about with Pandoc's dialect of Markdown was that it was so tied to Pandoc, there are no other implementations. Asciidoc on the other hand has at least two other implementations and so the tools and documentation is more mature.  </p>
<p>So you can see the tutorial at <a href="http://maths.tlocke.org.uk/">http://maths.tlocke.org.uk/</a> and the repository is at <a href="https://github.com/tlocke/maths">https://github.com/tlocke/maths</a>.  </p>
<p>One other thing I learnt while from all this is how much is owed to LaTeX. It really is the grandfather of markup.</p>
